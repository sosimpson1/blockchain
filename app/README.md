6 hours of debugging, 30 minutes to clean up the code, one hour for the documentation.

WIth more time, i would have implemented LiveData with My ViewModel, the search result is not working as it should when you input info it causes a crash(Fixed, not crashing anymore).
The UI, i did not do much on the Images in the UI, i will need to download bunch of characters and show them up.
